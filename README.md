Hungerr is a clone website of swiggy.com. Technologies used in my project are -

• Data fetching from the Swiggy website
• All the restaurant details with their menus
• Config Driven UI
• Adding items to the cart based on the restaurant
• Shimmer UI for loading restaurant pages
• Search option to search any restaurant
• Add, update and delete itmes from cart and restaurant menu page

I've built this complete website using React JS, Redux - Toolkit, JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
